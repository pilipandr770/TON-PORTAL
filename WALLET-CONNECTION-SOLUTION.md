# ✅ WALLET CONNECTION - WORKING SOLUTION

## 🎉 SUCCESS! Wallet connects perfectly!

### Problem History:
1. ❌ QR code displayed, but wallet confirmation wasn't received by website
2. ❌ Website didn't update after user approved connection in mobile wallet
3. ❌ onStatusChange callback wasn't firing

### Root Cause:
**CSP (Content-Security-Policy) was blocking WebSocket connections from bridge servers**

When user confirms connection in wallet:
```
Wallet → Bridge Server (via WebSocket) → Website (via WebSocket)
                                          ↑
                                  This was BLOCKED by CSP!
```

### The Fix:

**File: `app.py` - Lines 77-93**

```python
resp.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
    "default-src 'self'; "
    "img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; "
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
    "script-src 'self' https://unpkg.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; "
    "connect-src 'self' "
        # TonConnect registry
        "https://ton-connect.github.io "
        # Toncenter API
        "https://toncenter.com https://testnet.toncenter.com "
        # Bridge servers (HTTPS + WSS)
        "https://bridge.tonapi.io wss://bridge.tonapi.io "
        "https://*.tonapi.io wss://*.tonapi.io "
        "https://connect.tonhubapi.com wss://connect.tonhubapi.com "
        "https://*.tonhub.com wss://*.tonhub.com "
        "https://*.tonkeeper.com wss://*.tonkeeper.com "
        "https://tonconnectbridge.mytonwallet.org wss://tonconnectbridge.mytonwallet.org "
        "https://*.wallet.tg wss://*.wallet.tg "
        "https://wallet.tg wss://wallet.tg "
        "https://api.defillama.com "
        # ⭐ CRITICAL: Wildcard for ALL WebSocket connections
        "wss://*;"
)
```

**Key addition: `wss://*`** - This allows ALL WebSocket connections!

### Simple Script (tonconnect-ui-init-simple.js):

```javascript
// 1. Wait for library (30 attempts × 500ms = 15 seconds)
function waitForLibrary(attempt = 0) {
  if (window.TON_CONNECT_UI || window.TonConnectUI) {
    initUI();
  } else if (attempt < 30) {
    setTimeout(() => waitForLibrary(attempt + 1), 500);
  }
}

// 2. Initialize TonConnect UI
function initUI() {
  const ui = new TonConnectUI({
    manifestUrl: window.location.origin + '/tonconnect-manifest.json',
    buttonRootId: 'tonconnect-ui-button'
  });
  
  // 3. Listen for wallet status changes
  ui.onStatusChange((wallet) => {
    if (wallet && wallet.account) {
      // ✅ Connected! Update UI with address and balance
      document.getElementById('addr').textContent = wallet.account.address;
      // ... load balance ...
    }
  });
}
```

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `app.py` - Added comprehensive CSP with `wss://*`
2. ✅ `static/js/tonconnect-ui-init-simple.js` - Simple 90-line script
3. ✅ `templates/base.html` - Load simple script instead of complex one

### Testing Checklist:
- ✅ QR code displays
- ✅ User scans QR in Tonkeeper
- ✅ User confirms connection
- ✅ QR closes automatically
- ✅ Address appears on website
- ✅ Balance loads correctly

### Connection Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet" button
   ↓
2. TonConnect UI displays QR code with session ID
   ↓
3. User scans QR in mobile wallet (Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet, etc.)
   ↓
4. Wallet connects to bridge server (e.g., bridge.tonapi.io)
   ↓
5. Wallet sends confirmation: { session_id, address, public_key }
   ↓
6. Bridge stores in memory
   ↓
7. Website connects to SAME bridge via WebSocket (wss://)
   ↓
8. Bridge pushes wallet info to website ← WAS BLOCKED, NOW WORKS!
   ↓
9. onStatusChange callback fires
   ↓
10. UI updates with address and balance
    ✅ SUCCESS!
```

### Why It Works Now:

**Before:** CSP blocked specific bridge servers → missed some wallets
**After:** `wss://*` allows ANY bridge server → works with ALL wallets!

### Production Deployment:
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Render.com auto-deploys from main branch
- ✅ Live at: https://ton-portal.onrender.com

### Console Output (Success):
```
TonConnect init started
Check attempt: 0
✅ Library found!
Creating TonConnect UI with manifest: https://...
✅ TonConnect UI created
Connection check - Connected: false Wallet: No
[User scans QR and confirms]
🔔🔔🔔 WALLET STATUS CHANGED 🔔🔔🔔
Full wallet object: { account: { address: "EQAbc...", ... } }
✅ Connected: EQAbc...xyz
Balance loaded: 12.5 TON
```

## 📝 Remember This Solution:

**For future TonConnect wallet connection issues:**

1. **Check CSP first!** - Must allow `wss://*` or specific bridge servers
2. **Use simple script** - Less code = fewer bugs
3. **Log everything** - Console logs help debug
4. **Test WebSocket** - Bridge communication is the key

**The golden rule:** If wallet shows QR but website doesn't receive confirmation → CSP is blocking WebSocket!
