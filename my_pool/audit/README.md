## Audit Checklist

Before launching on mainnet, verify:

- [ ] Smart contract audited by reputable firm
- [ ] All critical/high severity issues resolved
- [ ] Code deployed matches audited code (hash verification)
- [ ] Get-methods return expected values
- [ ] Owner address is zero (0:0000...)
- [ ] Contract is non-upgradeable
- [ ] Testnet operation successful (30+ days, no issues)
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Key management security verified
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts operational

## Recommended Auditors

### TON-Specific Auditors
1. **TON Foundation Security Team**
2. **Orbs Network** (TON ecosystem)
3. **Community auditors** (via TON dev community)

## Self-Audit (Before Professional Audit)

### Smart Contract Checklist
- [ ] No owner privileges (owner = zero address)
- [ ] No upgrade functions
- [ ] Reentrancy protection
- [ ] Integer overflow protection
- [ ] Access control properly implemented
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism (if applicable)
- [ ] Gas optimization reviewed
- [ ] All external calls checked

### Infrastructure Checklist
- [ ] HSM for key storage
- [ ] Multi-signature backup keys
- [ ] 2FA on all admin access
- [ ] IP whitelist for sensitive operations
- [ ] DDoS protection active
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Backup validator ready
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** disclose publicly
2. **Email**: andrii.it.info@gmail.com with subject "SECURITY: PORTAL Pool"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

**Bug Bounty**: We appreciate responsible disclosure. Rewards for critical findings:
- Critical: 500-2000 EUR (based on severity)
- High: 200-500 EUR
- Medium: 50-200 EUR
- Low/Info: Recognition in hall of fame

## Continuous Monitoring

Post-deployment, we continuously monitor:

- Smart contract interactions (unusual patterns)
- Validator performance (missed blocks, slashing)
- Infrastructure security (intrusion attempts)
- Dependency updates (TonConnect, libraries)
